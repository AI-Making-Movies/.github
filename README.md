# AI Making Movies

This organisation exists to explore **AI-assisted movie making** as an emerging, experimental practice — not as a replacement for professional filmmaking, but as a *new and incomplete* creative terrain.

The work here is process-led, exploratory, and openly reflective about limitations, failures, and trade-offs.

---

## What this is

- An open creative lab for **AI-assisted visual storytelling**
- A place to document **workflows, experiments, and lessons learned**
- A space to explore **story-first approaches** using imperfect tools
- An acknowledgement that this is *not* traditional filmmaking

This work sits somewhere between:
- writing
- storyboarding
- visual design
- music
- experimentation

It does not claim industry equivalence.

---

## What this is *not*

- Not a replacement for professional filmmakers
- Not a claim of mastery
- Not a finished methodology
- Not a content factory
- Not a community with obligations or expectations

There are no guarantees of response, feedback, or timelines.

## Why “AI Making Movies”

The term is used deliberately.

AI-assisted movie making is currently:
- technically constrained
- aesthetically inconsistent
- ethically unresolved
- creatively uneven

That is precisely why it is worth documenting honestly.

This organisation exists to **observe the process while it is still unstable**, rather than pretending the answers already exist.

---

## How this space is used

- Repositories may appear, change, or disappear
- Some projects may never be finished
- Some ideas may only exist as first scenes or visual tests
- Silence does not mean abandonment

If something resonates, engage.
If not, pass quietly.

---

## Tone & participation

- Asynchronous
- Low noise
- No hype
- No performative posting
- No obligation to participate

This is a long-arc exploration, not a feed.

## Related work

- Storyboard management software and documentation live separately
- Books, music, and film projects may feed into this space over time

Links will appear when relevant.

This organisation is intentionally small, slow, and incomplete.
That is part of the work.
